    "Python scripting is powerful, but what is even more powerful is turning a script into a GRASS tool with just a few tricks and tweaks we will cover in this workshop. When you develop a GRASS tool (aka module), you get a graphical user interface (GUI), command line interface, and convenience you and your users will appreciate. Such tools can be published in a community-maintained addon repository which helps not only to distribute the tool, but also to maintain the code in the long term.\n",

    "\n",
    "If the tool's behavior can be modified by users in some way, e.g., when its handling of nulls (no data) can be modified, a flag can be used to ask for that alternative behavior. Flags are like options which are booleans with default false with names which are only one character. They are defined using:\n",

    "```\n",

    "However, options are often better because they improve readability, clarify the default behavior, and allow for extension of the interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a tool which produces text output which by default produces human-readable plain text output. Then you add JSON output which is enabled by a flag `j`. Later, you decide to add YAML output. This now needs to be flag `y` which needs to be exclusive with flag `j`. Soon, you have several related flags each exclusive with all the others. Using an option instead of flag from the beginning allows the interface to accommodate more formats. In this example, an option named `format` can have default value `plain` and `json` from JSON output. When you later add YAML, you simply add `yaml` to possible values without a need for additional options or flags. The interface definition for the example would look like:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# %option\n",
    "# % key: format\n",
    "# % type: string\n",

    "\n",
    "Tools should not change the computational region. This is done by specific tools, especially, by _g.region_.\n",
    "\n",
    "Raster processing tools should respect the current computational region. Vector processing tools may use the current computational region, e.g., to selected subset of the input data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Users should be able to re-run a command or workflow with different computational regions to, e.g., test processing in a small are and then move to a larger one.\n",
    "\n",
    "One exception to respecting the computational region rule are imports where respecting of the region is optional. The usual expectation is that the data is respected. Respecting of the region may be implemented as an optional feature. This is to avoid, e.g., importing data under finer resolution than the native resolution of the data. The tools should behave appropriately to the input data, for example, importing only the extent based on the current region may be appropriate for import of a global dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another exception is raster processing where alignment of the cells plays a crucial role and there is a clear answer to how the alignment should be done. In that case, the tool may change the resolution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some tools, such as _r.mapcalc_, opt for providing additional computation region handling policies. However, these require custom implementation and the general practice is to simply leave computation region handling out of the tool.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, some operations are meant use all the data, e.g., creating metadata, these operations should not use the current computational region.\n",
    "\n",
    "If a tool needs to change the computational region for part of the computation, temporary region in Python API is a simplest way to do that:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "gs.use_temp_region()  # From now on, use a separate region in the script.\n",
    "# Set the computational region with g.region as needed.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This makes any changes done in the tool local for the tool without influencing other tools running in the same session.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ultimate tool to change the computational region in a Python tool is the `GRASS_REGION` environment variable which is passed to subprocesses. (This generally works for any script, but not for tools which are using C libraries.) Python API has functions which help with the setup:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "os.environ[\"GRASS_REGION\"] = gs.region_env(raster=input_raster)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If different subprocesses need different regions, use different environments:\n",

    "env = os.environ.copy()\n",
    "env[\"GRASS_REGION\"] = gs.region_env(raster=input_raster)\n",
    "gs.run_command(\"r.slope.aspect\", elevation=input_raster, slope=slope, env=env)\n",

Raster tools called as subprocess will automatically respect the globally set mask when reading the data. For outputs, respecting of the mask is optional.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the tool can't avoid setting the mask internally, it should check for presence of the mask and fail if the mask is present. The tools should not remove and later restore the original mask because that creates confusing behavior for interactive use and breaks parallel processing.\n",
