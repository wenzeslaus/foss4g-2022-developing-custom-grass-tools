    "# Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "These practices are for writing GRASS tools or scripts which can be used in the same way. For general, standalone scripts, most of these simply don't apply. However, the concepts and techniques might still be useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "The assumption is that the tools is written in Python. However, the advice applies to other scripting languages as well, although, when the Python API is not available, the underlying mechanism such as environment variables may need to be used directly. The same best practices apply to tools written in C in terms of behavior, but the way how to achieve the desired behavior might be different."

    "## Consider both Flags and Options to Modify Behavior\n",
    "\n",
    "If the tool's behavior can be modified by users in some way, e.g., when its handling of nulls (no data) can be modified, a flag can be used to ask for that alternative behavior. Flags are like options which are booleans with default false with names which are only one character. They are defined using:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# %flag\n",
    "# % key: n\n",
    "# % description: Consider zeros to be null values\n",
    "# %end\n",
    "```\n",

    "If the tool is used in Python, the flag would be used in the _flags_ parameter of _run_command_:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "gs.run_command(..., flags=\"n\", ...)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the command line, the flag would be used with dash as `-n`.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, options are often better because they improve readability, clarify the default behavior, and allow for extension of the interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a tool which produces text output which by default produces human-readable plain text output. Then you add JSON output which is enabled by a flag `j`. Later, you decide to add YAML output. This now needs to be flag `y` which needs to be exclusive with flag `j`. Soon, you have several related flags each exclusive with all the others. Using an option instead of flag from the beginning allows the interface to accommodate more formats. In this example, an option named `format` can have default value `plain` and `json` from JSON output. When you later add YAML, you simply add `yaml` to possible values without a need for additional options or flags. The interface definition for the example would look like:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# %option\n",
    "# % key: format\n",
    "# % type: string\n",
    "# % required: yes\n",
    "# % options: plain,json,yaml\n",
    "# % label: Output format\n",

    "# % answer: plain\n",
    "# %end\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Other typical cases where this applies include handling of computational region (e.g., `i` versus `extent=input`) or the aforementioned null handling (`n` for NULLs being zeros versus `nulls=zeros`, `nulls=nulls`, and `nulls=9999`)."

    "One exception to respecting the computational region rule are imports where respecting of the region is optional. The usual expectation is that the data is respected. Respecting of the region may be implemented as an optional feature. This is to avoid, e.g., importing data under finer resolution than the native resolution of the data. The tools should behave appropriately to the input data, for example, importing only the extent based on the current region may be appropriate for import of a global dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another exception is raster processing where alignment of the cells plays a crucial role and there is a clear answer to how the alignment should be done. In that case, the tool may change the resolution.\n",

    "The ultimate tool to change the computational region in a Python tool is the `GRASS_REGION` environment variable which is passed to subprocesses. (This generally works for any script, but not for tools which are using C libraries.) Python API has functions which help with the setup:\n",

    "```python\n",
    "os.environ[\"GRASS_REGION\"] = gs.region_env(raster=input_raster)\n",
